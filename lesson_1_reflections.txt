How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
By viewing the two different versions of a file we can compare the changes between the contents of both the files and thus find the difference which is  causing the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
By having the easy access to the entire history of a file we can get back to any previous version which is better than the current version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros of manual commit is that the commit won't become too clutered and meningless whereas cons are that we may forget sometimes to commit the important information.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
It is more useful for coders.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Using git log we can see the previous commits then by using git diff and two commit ids we can get the difference between the two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
If any new change breaks something then by using version control we can go back to the previous versions of the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I would like to use it for my college project.
